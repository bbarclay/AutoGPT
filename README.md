These examples showcase just a fraction of what you can achieve with AutoGPT. Customize workflows to build agents tailored to your specific use cases.

---

## üîó Connecting Your Agents to a Model

AutoGPT supports various Large Language Models (LLMs) through multiple connection options. By default, your agents use the OpenAI API, but you can also configure them to use local models via tools like Ollama.

For detailed instructions on configuring your agents' connections to different models, refer to our [LLM Connections Documentation](https://docs.autogpt.com/how-to/LLM-Connections/).

## üìä How AutoGPT Compares

**AutoGPT's Advantage:** AutoGPT is built with production in mind, offering the flexibility of conversational agents and the structured process approach without rigidity. Its dynamic and adaptable processes integrate seamlessly into both development and production workflows.

| Feature               | **AutoGPT** | **Autogen** | **ChatDev**   |
|-----------------------|-------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Process Concept**   | ‚úÖ          | ‚ùå          | ‚úÖ (Rigid)     |
| **Flexibility**       | ‚úÖ          | ‚ùå          | ‚ùå             |
| **Scalability**       | ‚úÖ          | ‚ùå          | ‚ùå             |
| **Community Support** | ‚úÖ          | Limited     | Limited        |

- **Autogen:** While Autogen excels at creating conversational agents, it lacks an inherent process concept. Orchestrating agent interactions in Autogen requires additional programming, which can become complex as task scales increase.

- **ChatDev:** ChatDev introduces process-driven AI agents but its implementation is rigid. Customizations are limited and not geared towards scalable, production environments, hindering real-world application flexibility.

AutoGPT combines the strengths of both, providing a robust, flexible framework ideal for real-world AI automation needs.

## üìà Telemetry

AutoGPT uses anonymous telemetry to collect usage data to help improve the platform by focusing on the most used features, integrations, and tools. **No sensitive data** such as prompts, task descriptions, agents' backstories or goals, usage of tools, API calls, responses, data processed by agents, or secrets and environment variables are collected, except when the `share_crew` feature is enabled.

**Data Collected Includes:**

- Version of AutoGPT
- Version of Python
- General OS information (e.g., number of CPUs, macOS/Windows/Linux)
- Number of agents and tasks in a crew
- Crew process being used
- Whether agents are using memory or allowing delegation
- Task execution mode (parallel or sequential)
- Language model being used
- Roles of agents in a crew
- Names of tools available

**Users can opt-in to Further Telemetry** by enabling the `share_crew` attribute, which allows the collection of detailed crew and task execution data, including goals, backstories, contexts, and task outputs. This provides deeper insights while respecting user privacy.
